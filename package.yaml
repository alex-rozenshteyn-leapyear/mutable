description: |
    Associate and generate "piecewise-mutable" versions for your composite data
    types.  Think of it like a "generalized MVector for all ADTs".

    Useful for a situation where you have a record with many fields (or many nested
    records) that you want to use for efficient mutable in-place algorithms.  This
    library lets you do efficient "piecewise" mutations (operations that only edit
    one field), and also efficient entire-datatype copies/updates, as well, in many
    cases.

    See <https://mutable.jle.im> for official introduction and documentation,
    or jump right in by importing "Data.Mutable".
